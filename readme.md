# Python Math plots

Kaya's wonderful journey towards the stars: 
A tale of those who stood up again after falling in muddy pools of disgrace.

## Introduction - The projects' aim

The reason to make this project is to track development in Mathematics and Astronomy using VSCode, in Python, with modules like matplotlib, numpy and neurokit2. Together with inspirational copy paste's of other projects on the net. 
Another reason for this project is to try to emulate and follow the in the footsteps of the great mathematicians and astronomers and perhaps learn and co-develop in the fields of astro-science. 
All in order to gain more understanding of the ultra-fine Scheme of the Universe, for the Pleasure of the Grand Designer.


## Technologies
